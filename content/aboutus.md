### What is this?
AboutMy.email lets you send an email to a unique address, then it will tell you many things about it.


 * Authentication - SPF, DKIM, DMARC and BIMI
 * Content - the raw payload as sent, mime elements
 * Images - details about the external images used by the mail
 * Unsubscription - all sorts of ways of unsubscribing, including List-Unsubscribe and RFC 8058 List-Unsubscribe-Post
 * Best Practices - such as those required by Yahoo and Gmail for bulk senders

It's still very much in an alpha release state,
so expect to see some bugs. If you find any feel
free to [file a bug or mention it on Slack](help).

### Who are you?

We are [Word to the Wise](https://wordtothewise.com/), an Email consulting company based in Dublin, Ireland.

### What else do you do?

Word to the Wise was founded by Steve & Laura Atkins in 2001, in the heart of Silicon Valley.

We were one of the first companies to offer email senders strategic advice on email delivery and program management, and continues to be at the forefront of the industry helping companies develop and manage sustainable email programs.

Two decades later, weâ€™re based in Dublin, Ireland and still offering a boutique, hands-on approach to solving email problems and building sustainable email programmes, both as Word to the Wise and under our Irish name, Turscar.

We are a trusted advisor not only to email senders of all sizes, but also to many of the email and internet service providers who support those companies. When in-house experts need additional advice and support, we can provide both short-term and long-term assistance in navigating those challenges.
